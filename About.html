      <h3> Artist Statement</h3>
    <h5> Tina Truong </h5>
<br>
Ever since I was little my older brother introduced me to a plethora of video games. From Monkey Ball to Astro Boy, Pikmin to Bomberman, the list continues to this day. But apart from video games, I took an interest in art at a young age as well. Because of that duality in my earlier years, it stuck and grew up with me as my skills have developed over time. Present day, my skills are all over the place when it comes to different mediums but the strongest one has to be with pencil sketches. I favor that you have a lot of control over how much of the product is being used and that you have control over where the pencil marks go and how easy it is to erase any mistakes. Currently I am transferring those set of skills to the digital medium because I feel it is a good idea to be efficient in technology when it comes to art as the continuation of art and technology further advances.  
<br>
<br>
If I was asked, “Where do you see your art taking you ten years from now?” I would say hopefully it would be in video games. Whether it be in landscape design or character design I think video games are a useful tool in building not only creativity but opening someone's mind and perspective. Video games, and all new media art have an advantage that most traditional art do not have, and that’s immersion. When traditional art stops at the third dimension, video games can take that to the next level with virtual reality. Although I do not have much experience in creating virtual reality games, I am fairly experienced in playing them and appreciating how amazing such a tool can be to opening up a whole new world that we can create.  
<br>
<br>
I love games that open your eyes to all kinds of different situations and have you decide on the spot how your character would react in that position. I think that is very helpful for the person playing as it immerses the player and often builds the critical thinking function in their brain. Because of that, I have a personal love for games that have quick time actions, different scenes that happen according to your decision-making therefore leading to multiple different endings to the game. I have come across some games that do take up that style in gameplay and my brother and I will usually play the game in polar opposite decisions, only to find out that the games ending does not change that much or is drastic enough. So when I get into the video game industry, I would try my hardest in being a part of a company that fulfills a more dynamic route all the while getting people to see certain situations possibly from a different perspective.  
<br>
<br>
All in all, I still have so much to learn and develop when it comes to my skills in art. I am still learning that mistakes are okay to make as long as you overcome them and that art is a great form of self-expression and utilizing those set of skills with the ever-advancing form of technology, you have a pretty powerful tool in however you decide to use it.</p>
